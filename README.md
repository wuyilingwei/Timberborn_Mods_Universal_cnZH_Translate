# Timberborn_Mods_Universal_cnZH_Translate

This project provides Chinese support for Timberborn's creative workshop mod.

It uses a hybrid model of AI and manual work, with AI responsible for providing translation support as quickly as possible and reducing workload, and manual work for proofreading and modification.

We are not responsible for the accuracy of the translated text.

The content that is not accepted for translation is:

 - ID Beaver.* This part seems to be used internally in the game. Modifying it may cause unpredictable modifications to the main body and violate our "universal" principle. Players who do not install the corresponding mod may be modified.
 - Any content that violates the policies and laws of mainland China/Canada/the United States Given that our members and hosted services are located in these countries or regions, in order to avoid potential problems, this part of the content will not be translated.
